## 💎 CyxWiz Engine

**CyxWiz Engine** is our flagship desktop application—a revolutionary visual IDE for machine learning development that transforms how AI practitioners work.

### Why CyxWiz Engine Exists

Traditional ML development is fragmented. Data scientists jump between Jupyter notebooks, TensorFlow scripts, cloud dashboards, and command-line tools. This workflow is inefficient, error-prone, and inaccessible to many who could benefit from ML.

**We built CyxWiz Engine to change that.**

### The Vision

Imagine a world where:
- **Visual Node Editor**: Build neural networks by connecting nodes—no boilerplate code required
- **Real-Time Training Visualization**: Watch your models learn with live loss curves, metric dashboards, and performance analytics
- **Distributed Training**: Submit jobs to our decentralized network with a single click—train on hundreds of GPUs worldwide
- **Python Integration**: Drop into code when you need it, with embedded scripting and custom layer support
- **Blockchain-Native**: Automatic payment distribution, model NFTs, and provenance tracking built-in
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux—one unified experience

### Built For

- **Researchers**: Focus on experimentation, not infrastructure
- **Startups**: Train production models without massive cloud bills
- **Educators**: Teach ML concepts visually and interactively
- **Enterprises**: Deploy secure, compliant AI workflows
- **Hobbyists**: Bring your ML ideas to life without a PhD

### Technology Stack

CyxWiz Engine leverages cutting-edge technology:
- **C++20** for high-performance compute
- **Dear ImGui** for beautiful, responsive UI
- **ArrayFire** for GPU-accelerated tensor operations (CUDA, OpenCL, Metal)
- **gRPC** for distributed communication
- **Solana** blockchain for decentralized orchestration
- **Python (pybind11)** for extensibility
