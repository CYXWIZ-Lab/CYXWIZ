# Data Studio

Data Studio is where you look at your data with SQL, a profile and quick
charts, without changing the graph. Open it from the Data Studio tab (or the
sidebar).

## Picking a dataset

The **Dataset** list at the top shows every dataset the Engine holds:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| name | What the graph calls it: the Data Input node's name ("Spotify"). Hover for the dataset's own name (`ds_datainput_1`); a query can use either. |
| origin | *Data Input*, *node result* (a node's output after a run), or *older dataset*. |
| kind | *table (in memory)*, *table (on disk, Parquet)* for large files, *sparse features*, *images*, *audio*, *text*. |
| size | rows (or files / clips) and columns or classes. |

A Data Input appears once it is loaded: open its dialog and Apply, or open a
Plot node fed by it. The list updates when a dataset is loaded, re-loaded or
removed. **Refresh** reads the picked dataset again; **Open Node Editor**
goes to CyxWiz Studio.

## Query

Write SQL that names tables by their names, in double quotes when the name
has spaces or capitals:

```sql
SELECT album_type, count(*) AS tracks, round(avg(track_popularity), 1) AS popularity
FROM "Spotify"
GROUP BY album_type
ORDER BY tracks DESC
```

| album_type | tracks | popularity |
|---|---|---|
| album | 5856 | 55.7 |
| single | 2219 | 46.4 |
| compilation | 507 | 40.5 |

- **Run** (or **Ctrl+Enter** while the editor has focus) runs the query in
  the background: the Engine stays responsive, Task View shows it, and
  **Cancel** stops it. One query runs at a time.
- Several tables in one query: `JOIN "Spotify" s ... JOIN "World countries" w`.
  Large datasets kept on disk (Parquet) can be queried too.
- The line under the editor lists the tables you can name now.
- Only reading is allowed: one `SELECT` (or `WITH ... SELECT`). Changing data
  belongs in the graph (the SQL node, Filter Rows, ...). Queries cannot read
  files or reach the network.
- **Examples** fills in queries for the picked dataset, using its real
  columns: first rows, count, rows per value, average per value, a filter,
  columns and their types.
- **Clear** empties the editor.

The result line says **exact** (every row shown) or **first 100,000 rows**
(more rows than are shown), then rows, columns, the tables read (with their
rows) and the time. Then:

- **Open in Table Viewer**: the result as a table you can sort, filter and
  plot from.
- **Plot**: opens the Plot window on the result (a category and a number
  open as bars, two numbers as a scatter, one number as a histogram; change
  the type there).
- **Save as Dataset**: runs the query again over all rows and saves the
  result under a name; it then appears in the Dataset list and can be named
  in other queries.

Errors are shown under the buttons in plain words (for example "Only reading
is allowed here" or DuckDB's message for a typo).

## Profile

Profile (it replaced Analyze) describes the picked table and decides what
each column is. It runs in the background as soon as a dataset is picked,
and again when the dataset is re-loaded; **Profile again** runs it by hand.

The first line: rows, columns, when it was profiled and how long it took,
*exact* (or *approximate* on very wide tables, beyond 64 columns, where
distinct counts and quartiles are estimated). The second line counts the
columns per role, then **missing cells**, **duplicate rows** and **data
quality** (100 minus twice the share of missing cells).

The table has a row per column: type, **role**, where the role comes from,
the values (range, dates from - to, or distinct values), missing (count and
share), mean, std, median and outliers (outside 1.5 times the interquartile
range).

### Column roles

Each column has one role: **ID**, **Target**, **Numeric**, **Category**,
**Date**, **Text**, **File path**, **Weight** or **Ignore**. The *from*
column says who decided:

- **contract**: the graph. The Data Input's label column is the Target. It
  cannot be changed here; change the label in the Data Input.
- **you**: set here. Click the role and pick another (or **Back to
  inferred**). Saved with the project in `datasets/column_roles.json` for
  this file, and used by dashboards, plots and Visualize.
- **inferred**: guessed from the values: text unique per row is an ID, a
  name ending in `_id` is an ID, dates are Date, yes/no and numbers with up
  to 12 values are Category, long or mostly different text is Text, image or
  audio file names are File path, other numbers are Numeric.

Contract first, then yours, then inferred. Setting a different role on the
graph's target shows a warning: training keeps the Data Input label.

Example (Spotify, 8,582 rows): track_id and album_id are ID, album_type,
explicit, artist_name and artist_genres are Category, track_name and
album_name are Text, album_release_date is Date (1952-09-12 to 2025-10-31),
the rest Numeric. Profiled in 0.3 s.

### A column's details

Click a column for its distribution (a histogram for numbers, the most
frequent values otherwise) and its figures (non-missing, missing, distinct,
min, quartiles, max, mean, std, outliers, text length, type).

**Treat as missing**: some files write missing values as text (`N/A`, `-`,
`none`). Type them, comma separated, and **Apply**: the profile counts them
as missing (saved with the project for this file). When a frequent value
looks like one, the panel suggests it. Spotify's artist_genres has `N/A` in
3,361 rows (39.2%); treated as missing, the table has 2.6% missing cells.

The strongest correlations between number columns (Pearson) are listed
under the details (Spotify: artist_popularity and artist_followers +0.64).

## Visualize

Visualize still works on the picked dataset as before; it becomes a
one-chart builder on the same plot types with the Dashboard.
